 Truly Free AI Coding Assistants

 ✅ Codeium / Windsurf
	•	One of the most popular free Copilot-like coding assistants.
	•	Works inside VS Code and other editors.
	•	Offers AI autocompletion and code generation without a paid plan.
	•	Many developers use it instead of Copilot because the free tier is generous.  ￼

✅ Amazon CodeWhisperer
	•	Free tier available from AWS.
	•	Provides context-aware code suggestions inside editors like VS Code.
	•	Good option if you often work with cloud/AWS technologies.  ￼

🧠 Tabnine
	•	Offers AI code completion across many languages.
	•	Free tier supports basic suggestions (quality varies).
	•	Can run locally for privacy.  ￼

💬 Microsoft IntelliCode
	•	Built-in machine-learning–powered code suggestions for VS Code.
	•	Not exactly like Copilot’s chat, but gives smarter autocompletes.
	•	Free for all VS Code users.  ￼

✔ These tools aren’t exact 1-to-1 replacements for Copilot’s features (especially Copilot Chat), but they offer autocompletion, code suggestions, generation, and even some natural-language AI help without charging you.  ￼
